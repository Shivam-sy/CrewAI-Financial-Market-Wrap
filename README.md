# CrewAI-Financial-Market-Wrap
A Python backend workflow built with CrewAI and LiteLLM that generates a daily US financial market summary after market close. The system uses Tavily API to fetch financial news, Groq LLM to summarize, formats results with relevant charts, and sends the update directly to a Telegram channel.
